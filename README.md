This repository contains scripts and models for analyzing energy data and making predictions on various key metrics related to renewable energy, gas plants, and coal plant phase-out. The primary focus is on using linear regression and multiple linear regression (MLR) models to derive actionable insights.

## Features:
### Data Analysis:
- Comprehensive analysis of energy data to identify trends and patterns.

### Linear Predictions:
- Renewable Energy: Predict the date when the share of renewables will exceed 85%.
- Gas Plants: Predict the date when the share of gas plants will drop below 10%.
- Coal Plants: Predict the date when all coal plants will be phased out.

### MLR Regression Model for Day-Ahead Price:
- Develop and evaluate multiple linear regression models to find the best fitting model for predicting the day-ahead energy price.
